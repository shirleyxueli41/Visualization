# Pie Charts on US Map: Energy Sources by State
## Overview
This repository contains the R script "Pie_Charts_on_US_Map_Energy_Sources_by_State.R" which visualizes the distribution of different energy sources (gas, coal, wind, and solar) across selected U.S. states. The visualization includes pie charts placed on a U.S. map to represent the energy source proportions in each state.

## Dependencies
The script relies on the following R libraries:

usmap
ggplot2
scatterpie
RColorBrewer

## Usage
To run the script, ensure that you have the required libraries installed in your R environment. You can execute the script in an R environment such as RStudio.

## Customization
The script includes parameters for manually adjusting the positions of pie charts to avoid overlap and modifying the appearance of the map and charts. Feel free to adjust these as needed for your specific visualization preferences.
